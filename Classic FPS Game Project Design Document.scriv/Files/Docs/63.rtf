\par\pard\plain \sa140\sl288\slmult1\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The pickup procedure is roughly as follows: if a pickup is overlapped, or if the player \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93operates\u8221\'94 the pickup, its unique name (or just the regular name in the case of keys) is added to the list of pickups found.  Then it is determined whether or not the item can in fact be picked up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If the player does not already have the item, it is picked up (depending on the pickup, it might be destroyed and its data added to the player rather than the object literally being attached to the player).  If the player already has the item but it is of a type that can be depleted (such as ammo or a weapon), the item the player has is replenished with the pickup\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s amount (if it is positive) and the pickup is destroyed.  Otherwise, the pickup is ignored (though if it is a physics body, it may be nudged by the player).}}
